    The strength of an edge is quantified in terms of distance between conditional distributions of the target node in
    the original graph and the imputed graph wherein the edge has been removed and the target node is fed a random
    permutation of the observations of the source node. For more scientific details behind this API, please refer to

                         edges for.
    :param target_node: The target node whose incoming edges' strength is to be computed.
    :param parent_samples: Optional samples from the parents of the target_node. If None are given, they are generated
                           based on the provided causal model. Providing observational data can help to mitigate
                           misspecifications in the graph, such as missing interactions between root nodes or
                           confounders.
    :param num_samples_conditional: Sample size to use for estimating the distance between distributions. The more
                                    more samples, the higher the accuracy.
    :param max_num_runs: The maximum number of times to resample and estimate the strength to report the average
                         strength.
    :param tolerance: If the percentage change in the estimated strength between two consecutive runs falls below the
                      specified tolerance, the algorithm will terminate before reaching the maximum number of runs.
                      A value of 0.01 would indicate a change of less than 1%. However, in order to minimize the impact
                      of randomness, there must be at least three consecutive runs where the change is below the
                      threshold.
    :param n_jobs: The number of jobs to run in parallel. Set it to -1 to use all processors.
    :param difference_estimation_func: Optional: How to measure the distance between two distributions. By default,
                                       the difference of the variance is estimated for a continuous target node
                                       and the KL divergence for a categorical target node.

                             'approx' or the string 'exact'. With 'exact', the underlying causal models in the graph

                             that generated samples follow the fitted models. In contrast, the 'approx' method involves
                             selecting and training a suitable model based on data sampled from the graph. This might
                             lead to deviations from the outcomes of the fitted models, but is faster and can be more

                             predictions can be typically ignored if one is interested in uncertainty measures such as
                             entropy or variance, but they might be relevant if, for instance, these shall be estimated
                             based on the residuals. By default, entropy is used if prediction model is a classifier,
